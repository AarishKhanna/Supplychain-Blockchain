# Supply Chain Blockchain D-App

This Decentralized Application is designed with blockchain technology using solidity, truffle, web3.js and front-end development.


## How to Use the D-App

Metamask is necessary to use the app.
Make sure you have an account on it. Go to Chrome-extensions to add Metamask.

This project is Deployed on Rinkeby Testnet. Fund your account with some rinkeby test ether to use the D-app.
You can visit rinkeby etherscan for previous transaction history that you will have on this D-App.


# Aim of the D-App:

This D-app is more secure, efficient, trust worthy solution for Supply Chain Problem
In this D-app you can create your item, put it for selling, after the item is bought,
you can put it for delievery, and after delievery you can mark it as delievered.

All the steps will be written on the blockchain, thus no chance of fraud is there.

Project is powered by robust smart contracts written with solidity.
